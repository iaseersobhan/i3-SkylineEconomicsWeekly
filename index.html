    <h2>
Is climate change a failure of markets or a failure of law and governance?
</h2>
    <div class="author">By Ahmed Iaseer Sobhan</div>
    <p> 
 <p> 

Climate change is often described as the greatest failure of the free market in human history. Still, this label raises a more complex question: if markets must operate within institutional and legal frameworks designed by governments and administrations, is it possible for a market to fail independently of these structures? To uncover the root of the “greatest market failure in human history” one must first closely examine the relationship between institutional design and economic incentives.

</p>
</p>

Through a strictly economic perspective, climate change appears to fulfill all the criteria for a perfect example of market failure. Greenhouse gas emissions can be considered a negative externality, this is because they are a cost imposed on society that cannot be effectively or accurately reflected in the price of production or cost of consumption. Consequently, individuals and firms continue to emit carbon as it can be argued that it is economically rational, environmental costs cannot be accurately quantified, and thus cannot be internalized. In theory, accurate price signals are a necessity for markets to function efficiently. So, when carbon carries little or no price, markets logically opt to overproduce emission intensive goods, and underinvest in more expensive clean alternatives. The result of these systematic choices is a misallocation of resources on an international scale. 

</p>
</p>

However, since markets do not emerge naturally but instead through rigorous construction and adherence to legal frameworks, this diagnosis only explains the systems involved with the problem, but not its true origin. Accordingly, because markets hinge on intense continuity, it can be suggested that carbon remaining underpriced is not due to markets being unable to price it, but due to the failure of legal systems in imposing truly consequential carbon specific mechanisms on firms. This includes high carbon taxes, emissions trading systems and strict environmental regulations. From this, the claim can be made that climate change reflects less a market failure, and more an institutional failure in correcting predictable externalities. 

</p>
</p>

Unfortunately, climate change cannot be simplified and summed up to be the result of the whole world’s negligence (as is the typical antagonist in public discourse). All governments face obvious incentives to prioritize domestic economic growth over long term environmental stability. Although international agreements have been implemented to counteract these incentives, they are often symbolic and lack any sense of enforceability. States and institutions collectively benefit from global mitigation, yet must incur the costs individually. This undermines any sense of authority capable of imposing international environmental constraints, and thus the potential of the obvious solution. Markets continue to respond rationally by allocating carbon intensive production wherever regulations permit.  

</p>
</p>


In all, climate change cannot be considered a simple “market failure”, as fault cannot be exclusively attributed to markets or governance. Markets failed to price environmental costs, but did so under the legal and environmental regulations that permitted as such. Law and governance failed to correct externalities, but their decisions were shaped by the political and economic pressures to better their society. It is because of this that climate change represents the systemic failure of the very institutions that coordinate and organise modern economic life. A symbol for the point in which flawed incentives, weak global governance and a lack of market correction mechanisms culminate to produce outcomes that are economically rational yet detrimental to the long term health of our planet.

 <h2>Who Really Owns A City?  </h2>
<div class="author">

Throughout many decades, urban land has revealed itself as one of the most valuable economic assets in the world. Global cities such as London, New York and Singapore have experienced substantial increases in property prices, often at a rate surpassing that of income growth, ultimately resulting in significant affordability pressures for consumers. Although land is commonly viewed as privately owned, urban property ownership is far more complex in actuality. This is because property rights are essentially a mere subsection of the legal frameworks that allow governments to regulate and manipulate how land is developed, used and exchanged. As a result, the question of “who really owns a city?” refers more to the domain of law and public policy than just a private title. 

  </p>
  <p>
 Initially, ownership seems simple and straightforward. Individuals and firms hold the legal access to land through either freehold or leasing systems, effectively allowing them to buy, sell and develop property. Unfortunately, these rights are never absolute. Planning permissions, zoning laws and development controls are significant determinants of what landowners are permitted to do with “their own” land. Even if a landowner possesses formal ownership of a central plot, decisions in regard to building height, usage and density are determined by administrative institutions, most commonly the government. This makes it clear how legal systems and institutions are able to demonstrate influence over urban land despite the existence of private ownership. 
  </p>
  <p>
Additionally, this suggests that the housing markets of modern cities are constantly molded by ongoing negotiations between private property owners and regulatory institutions. Land may be owned privately, but its value and uses are fundamentally structured by law. Therefore, it can be argued that the true owner of a city is not the individuals who hold a legal title, but the institutions that define and enforce the rights of the title.
